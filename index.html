Wow! He makes bad puns to himself in the mirror in the morning. Immanuel Kant sells his suits and buys a flower shop that he names Kant-Forget-Me. Not every Immanuel Kant works in flower shops - this one does. Kant arrives at 5 a.m. when there are only the stars to distract him.

      <p>A boy comes in to work at the flower shop from the local high school. He spends all his time in the greenhouse, writing poetry. Sometimes his poems are about the flowers, but mostly they are about the girls who come in, and their skirts. The money that he gets from the flower shop is enough for him to marry a girl.

He congratulates Kant on having such a world-renowned flower shop, having it in a pretty famous magazine along with The Lone Arranger and Thistle Do Nicely. Kant smiles at Barthes but doesn’t really pay attention to that sort of thing.</p>

She likes that sometimes, he is scared of her flashing eyes. She even likes it when he tells her there is a touch of sublimity in her – even for the terror. He is not afraid of her untamed and he is not afraid of her bounded. She stays for a while.</p>

      <p>A man comes in. He is searching, he says, for one true flower.

They wear clothes that they made themselves. They do not look like men who have walked out of J. Crew or have ever seen J. Crew. Kant commiserates with them about how every flower in movies and television has been painted over, glossified. They prefer the tragedy of the flowers he keeps in buckets around the windows, who have begun wilting and putrefying. They give him twice as much money for the flowers that are sad, so sad that they could never be held in a magazine for brides. </p>

Cixous assures Kant that she has entire fields of flowers at home, talks about her house for a while, talks about the sunrise, talks about horses, talks about talking. Cixous says that some days she thinks the only reason she exists is her flowers in a field.

He talks to the baby’s breath in the corner for a long time. Kant steps into the back room for a moment and when he comes back Derrida is gone.</p>

      <p>Aristotle comes into the flower shop. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" title="From Aristotle’s Poetics, “I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds, noting the essential quality of each, to inquire into the structure of the plot as requisite to a good poem… and similarly into whatever else falls within the same inquiry”">Aristotle</span>  should be dead, right? But he very much wanted to see the most beautiful flowers in the world, all their arrangements, and the structure that went into them. Shelley is in the shop with Kant watching his old boss sit behind the counter and smile at the flowers that he has owned for so many long years. Shelley does not even notice Aristotle sitting there, telling Kant that the structure of flowers is also the structure of a good life: the solid stem, the realization, the petals of interactions with others. The best stories happen in one day in one place, with a realization before the end. Kant is not the best story, but he has lost himself in this one place. The stars on Kant’s walk home that night are breathtaking.</p>
