          <p>A man wakes up and he is Immanuel Kant. Wow! He makes bad puns to himself in the mirror. His walk to work takes nine hours because he is so damn universal. He walks a lady back and forth across a street for two hours, without planning to beforehand. Immanuel Kant decides that jobs should be agreeable and his had only been good. He sells his suits and buys a flower shop that he names Kant-Forget-Me. Not every Immanuel Kant works in flower shops - this one does. There are infinite Immanuel Kants, wandering up mountains and down rivers. Kant is never a photographer - it separates too much. Kant arrives at 5 a.m. when there are only the stars to distract him.</p>
         
          <p>Immanuel Kant, every night, gives away extra bouquets to anyone walking to dinner. Every night he encourages the people to whom he gives flowers to give them away. This, he says, is beautiful. They say the flowers are very beautiful, yes, and Kant shakes his head. Sometimes, if there is a homeless person, Kant will give them flowers to sell right around the corner from his flower shop. He can sell them for four times the price in his shop, which is ridiculous, but at least they can eat. Sometimes the homeless men ask them for food, to which Kant just laughs and shakes his head as though they had told him a great joke.</p>

          <p>Most of the time, Kant’s customers are still chained to the wall of the cave. Most of the time, they come in and tell him the shape of the germaniums is like a child’s smiling face, their heads moving like sunflowers around the tiny suns of the room. Most of the time, they say their favorite flowers are: anything except roses, because those are clichéd. Most of the time they say lilies remind them of \– well. Of something. Most of the time, Kant can still find the flowers inexplicably beautiful, even if selling them is filled with true interest.</p>

          <p>But once Freud comes into the flower shop and tells him about these dreams that he had. Kant and Freud talk about the tiger lilies in the corner. Freud says that lilies are, of course, phallic. Freud says that the flower had the voice of his father, Freud says that his father was Hamlet, Freud says that he shouldn’t even remember this from his dream. Freud talks for four hours about what the dream meant, other than that he was asleep. He laughs when Kant asks if, perhaps, he is focusing too much on the meaning.</p>

          <p>Sometimes Nietzsche comes in to buy flowers for his wife. The flowers, he says, are a lie. So is God. His wife and he have agreed that he will buy her flowers once a month and she will titter and understand that those flowers mean that he loves her. In February, Nietzsche places twice his usual order and tells Kant in the middle of the rush of people that he is building a garage behind his house that will be big enough to shield him form the other constructions his neighbors have been building up. He says that he has measured every single inch of the building. Both men are exhausted by the red hearts in every shop. </p>

          <p>Kant sells flowers in his flower shop. Some people think he has the most beautiful flowers in the world.</p>

          <p>Barbara Herrnstein-Smith comes into the flower shop and says that she is going to prove to him that he is charging too little for his flowers. She fights with him for three long weeks, following him home from the flower shop and not letting him get distracted for even a minute. She tells him that he shouldn’t sell exotic flowers because they didn’t evolve to cover the earth and don’t deserve to be sold. She decides as she leaves that he has placed personal economy on loving stupid, dying flowers. As she leaves, she tells him that his cash register is beautiful, because it is old-fashioned and he keeps his credit-card reader below the cash register. Barbara Herrnstein-Smith would love his credit card machine even more.</p>

          <p>A boy comes in to work at the flower shop from the local high school. The boy is young and boorish when he first gets there, but eventually he gets better at raising blooms. He spends most of his time in the greenhouse out back, losing himself in the flowers. Sometimes he writes poetry about the flowers while he’s sitting there and sometimes he writes poetry about the girls who come in with their skirts. The money that he gets from the flower shop is enough for him to marry a girl. She changes her last name to Shelley, because they are old-fashioned. </p>

          <p>People come to Kant-Forget-Me because they hear it is the most beautiful flower shop in the world. Gautier comes to flower shop and posts up flyers in the restroom about throwing away potatoes. There are pictures with potatoes with large red x’s drawn through them. Gautier stands in front of the flower shop and yells about the stain of decadence. Gautier really seems to hate the flower shop but he spends a lot of time among the roses nonetheless.
          Kant is selling lilies by the bucket to weddings.</p>

          <p>A man named Schiller writes letters to the local newspaper editor that are better than the rest of the newspaper combined. He mentions Kant-Forget-Me, he says that there is something timeless in the flowers there. He says that the children should be free to play in the greenhouse with the married Shelley, not that any of them want to. Their parents should play too, of course. Sometimes he implies that the shop shouldn’t exist to sell flowers, but what is he suggesting? That Immanuel Kant just live homeless instead of walking to work every day? That is silly. But Schiller is writing a manifesto and it’s more eloquent than the rest of the paper so everyone but Kant listens quietly when he speaks.</p>

          <p>Someone tells Kant to get a 401k so he hires Raymond Williams, accountant. Raymond Williams comes into the shop and settles into a back corner in a little desk. It may smell like fertilizer but there are no flowers there. Williams says that the flower shop would not be there if Kant didn’t need money as his base. He says that it’s nice, yes, that all these interesting people have come into the shop, would those interactions happen without the exchange of cash? Kant tries to explain that there is something beautiful in the small ding that the cash register makes. Williams says that the flower shop is a microcosm of the world’s economy and that, sadly, Kant will have to work with flowers for the rest of his life. Kant assures him that that is okay. </p>

          <p>Kant owns a flower shop and some summers are rainier than others.</p>

          <p>Matthew Arnold comes into the flower shop and suggests that, perhaps, Kant should stop getting such exotic flowers because religion is dying and flowers are where the greatness of society lies. Has Kant thought about just sort of going back to the English breeds of flowers? Or at least, has he thought to stop inter breeding flowers? That’s gross, dude. Kant laughs and asks Arnold if he’d like some extra-English posies. Arnold insists on reading some poetry that is more perfect than a constitutional amendment could ever be and gives Kant his own small book of verses before he buys the “English posies” and leaves. Both men are happier for it.</p>

          <p>Late in the year, Barthes comes into the shop and talks long about the general nature of flowers and of gardening and of culture in the context of this one flower shop. He congratulates Kant on having such a world-renowned flower shop, having it in a pretty famous magazine along with The Lone Arranger and Thistle Do Nicely. Kant smiles at Barthes but doesn’t really pay attention to that sort of thing. Barthes tells him that there is a Text between these walls, and that the work he is doing will continue no matter how dead Kant one day becomes. Kant is somehow not surprised that Barthes is one of the more normal customers that have come in.</p>

          <p>A woman named Susan Bordo walks into Kant’s flower shop. She likes that he owns a flower shop as a man, that he has sensitive eyes, that he sees the good in everyone. She likes that sometimes, he is scared of her flashing eyes. She even likes it when he tells her there is a touch of sublimity in her – even for the terror. He is not afraid of her untamed and he is not afraid of her bounded. He likes that she doesn’t always expect him to call her beautiful and that he can cook sumptuous meals for her, even if she doesn’t care either way for large bouquets of leftover flowers. One night, when she is very sad, she lays in bed with him and tells him stories of her grandmother who refused to leave her house, her sister whose ribs show through her all her dresses.  Kant names extravagantly fragrant and rich flowers after them. </p>

          <p> Kant has a flower shop and love, and his life is colloquially beautiful.</p>

          <p>A man comes in. He is searching, he says, for one true flower. He seems like he might be a fanatic, like he might come from God, he says over and over again he is seeking the one true flower. He is very old and has a very long beard, so Kant doesn’t break it to him that there is no perfect flower. The man says his name is Plato and he does not laugh at any of the other customers. Plato smacks a cellphone out of a man’s hand as he takes a picture of a rose. Representers, he mutters, staring at the fake daisies by the cash register. Kant tells him that, perhaps, he should look for the ideal flower outside of a flower shops. What is the chance God’s favorite flower would end up in a shop? Plato glares at him and tells him he should make flowers in the shapes of God and country flags.</p>

          <p>Immanuel Kant wakes up in the morning and he is still Immanuel Kant, luckily. He works in his flower shop.</p>

          <p>Saussure comes into the flower shop. Kant finds Saussure to be a funny man – so particular. Kant tries talking about the agreeable when Saussure talks about the signified, but Saussure is on a roll – Saussure doesn’t exist unless he is talking – Saussure comes into existence every time he opens his mouth.  Saussure explains to Kant that his flower-signifieds must be the most glorious in all the world. Kant thinks Saussure is saying there is something there, something greater behind the pinnings of the universe (the sky pinned to universe pinned to- what?) and Kant decides that behind the universe is the sublime-beauty – so big and terrifying. He watches Saussure’s round, round mouth enunciating the world into existence.</p>

          <p>Horkheimer walks in with his lover Adorno to buy flowers from the flower shop. They wear clothes that they made themselves. They do not look like men who have walked out of J. Crew or have ever seen J. Crew. Kant commiserates with them about how every flower in movies and television has been painted over, glossified. They prefer the tragedy of the flowers he keeps in buckets around the windows, who have begun wilting and putrefying. They give him twice as much money for the flowers that are sad, so sad that they could never be held in a magazine for brides. Kant feels guilty watching them take away the sad bucket of flowers, these old men who are so sadly in love. </p>

          <p>There is much suffering in the world, and for every sufferer Kant has flowers.</p>

          <p>Cleanth Brooks comes in. He has brought the urn that he wants his ashes to be put inside. While he is alive, he tells Kant, he wants to keep flowers in it. Kant asks him about this plan. Brooks talks about flowers. Kant asks what flowers mean to him. Brooks talks about the colors of the flowers. Kant sells him flowers. Brooks leaves.</p>

          <p>T.S. Eliot is very young and he comes in and throws stones at Shelley in the greenhouse. Shelley yells right back at him. Eliot says that goddamnit Shelley is such a good writer, shouldn’t he realize that sad thoughts don’t lead to beautiful poetry? Can’t he just get out of this glass room? Kant comes into greenhouse and manages to get Eliot to stop throwing rocks. He gets Eliot some tea. Eliot says that he was never angry at all.</p>

          <p>Susan Bordo likes Kant’s flowers and loves him, even if his flowers aren’t enough to change the world. She introduces him to one of her best friends, Helene Cixous, who is visiting from France. Cixous points out that Kant’s flowers have a tendency to be neatly arranged. Cixous assures Kant that she has entire fields of flowers at home, talks about her house for a while, talks about the sunrise, talks about horses, talks about talking. Cixous says that some days she thinks the only reason she exists is her flowers in a field.  Bordo thinks that meeting went very well, on the whole. </p>

          <p>Eagleton comes into the shop because he heard that Arnold had been in years before. Eagleton rails against the hegemony of flower shops, the inherited prestige in flowers from the shop versus flowers crawling up between sidewalk flagstones. Kant nods along, investing blooms into the buckets scattered around the old store, and agrees that Arnold was kind of a dick. Eagleton buys bouquets of the “English posies” and rips one up dramatically just outside the shop. Everyone loves Arnold not.  He then grows his own posies and places them around town, to disrupt everyone’s normalcy.</p>

          <p>Immanuel Kant is a very old man and he can’t smell the flowers as well, but he still thinks that his shop is important.
          A young man named Lacan comes in with a small collection of babies and toddlers that may or may not belong to him. Lacan may have stolen these babies from their mothers. He brings them all the Kant’s flower shop and the children hold flower stems in their sticky, fat fists.  Lacan lectures Kant on the importance of some mirrors in the place, on the floors and the ceilings and the walls too. A child crawls by his feet, seeking more blooms. Lacan assures Kant that his flowers would be much more individual with these improvements. Kant nods and says that the small shop would seem much bigger as well. Lacan gathers the sticky children and pays for his flowers and ushers them out of the flower shop.
          Kant’s eyes are going but he can still tell the different variations of carnations apart from across the room. </p>

          <p>Mallarme walks into a flower shop and starts playing the violin. He plays the violin for three hours, assuring all of Kant’s customers that music is better than the flowers will ever be. Mallarme follows the couples around the store playing sad, sweet songs for them, like a romantic gondolier of discomforting social interactions. Oh, Mallarme, thinks Kant, accepting the experience that the man offers his customers with a smile and a shrug. His other customers are used to the strangeness of his shop, and for a few moments forget themselves. This is enough for Kant. </p>

          <p>Derrida comes into the shop. He tells Kant that really he should be more concerned with the name of his shop than with flowers. While Derrida is confined in the shop, he does not believe that anything outside of it is real.  Derrida is skeptical about the roses, the orchids, the tulips. He talks to the baby’s breath in the corner for a long time. Kant suggest that perhaps Derrida should just let flowers be flowers, just once. He might like that. Kant steps into the back room for a moment and when he comes back Derrida is gone.</p>

          <p>Aristotle comes into the flower shop. Aristotle should be dead, right? But he very much wanted to see the most beautiful flowers in the world, all their arrangements, and the structure that went into them. Shelley is in the shop with Kant watching his old boss sit behind the counter and smile at the flowers that he has owned for so many long years. Shelley does not even notice Aristotle sitting there, next to Kant, telling him that the structure of flowers is also the structure of a good life: the solid stem, the realization, the petals of interactions with others. The best stories happen in one day in one place, with a realization before the end. Kant is not the best story, but he has lost himself in this one place. The stars on Kant’s walk home that night are breathtaking.</p>

          <p>Immanuel Kant goes like this: he has a dream that his flower shop has been ripped apart by a tornado. Kant is not scared of this sublime at all, he actually finds the tornado beautiful, but he knows that this is a death sentence. While he is still asleep, his breathing slows and the universe unpins itself for him.  Behind the universe, there are flowers.</p>
