<h2>Goals</h2>
<h3>"Learn something new and build something cool in a weekend."
</h3>
<p>For a weekend assignment, we were encouraged to learn new front-end libraries and put into practice some basic principles for them. I decided to learn Foundation and Skrollr because I knew I wanted to implement both technologies in later projects. I learned about the standardization of various grid systems used for front-end design work and about creating front-end effects that complement rather than pull attention away from content on the page.</p>

<h2>Technologies Learned</h2>
<p> Foundation, Skrollr </p>

<h2>Other Technologies Used</h2>
<p> Javascript, CSS, HTML, JQuery & a little magic </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy and clone to computer. Open the index.html file in browser.
